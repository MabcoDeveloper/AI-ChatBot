# Notes:
# - These versions were selected or tightened to be compatible with CPython 3.13.4.
# - If you need heavy numeric / ML libraries (e.g., numpy, sentence-transformers),
#   keep them out of the base requirements and add them to an extras or separate
#   requirements file (e.g., requirements-ml.txt) so deployments remain lightweight.
# - After editing, run `python -m pip install -r requirements.txt` in a clean venv
#   running Python 3.13.4 and run your test suite to validate.
